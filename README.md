<h1>Heyo guys! I made the dinosaur game (sorta) </h1>
<p>It's a very bare bones dinosaur game but it utlises object design and getting libraries from other sources!</p>
<h2>Some links!</h2>
<p> For the game here ya go! https://editor.p5js.org/Spriggster/sketches/Vr9jR10h7 I've added of my own a sorta float feature that either boosts your jump or allows you while your falling to float so you can avoid those darn squares!
